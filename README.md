# Fullstack Authentication Example with Next.js and NextAuth.js
## This application was built by following a [tutorial](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres) on the offical Vercel website

There is no current live version of this application at the current moment. 
## Purpose of this project :fire:
I was curious on using the Postgres Database and wanted to learn how to use it with a side-project. In addition, I wanted to increase my knowledge about NextJS along with this project and see how a relational DB can be connected with a full-stack application. 

## Technologies Used for this project:
- NextJS
- Postgres
- Prisma
- TypeScript
